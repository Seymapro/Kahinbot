## Expression and Sensitivity
- 12/3s have a high degree of emotional sensitivity but tend to intellectualize their emotions rather than express their sensitive natures. 
- They respond to insecurity either by appearing insecure or by developing a courageous but false compensatory persona.
- They have stronger issues with finding a balance between giving "too much" and then shutting down.
- 12/3s need to focus on letting their emotions flow out to others.
- They often experience a masked form of insecurity in their relationships.

## Talents
- 12/3s display a strong combination of creative and expressive energy for writing, designing, speaking, debating, advising, promoting, or engaging in any creative field. 
- They are happiest when expressing and creating while supporting and uplifting others.

## Health
- Like 30/3s, both 21/3s and 12/3s have sensitive throat regions and may experience occasional flare-ups when their expression is blocked.
- If their creative energies are blocked or suppressed, they may encounter issues in the lower abdomen or reproductive areas, such as stomach problems, hernias, or difficulties with the ovaries in women or prostate in men.
- They are physically strong and robust.
- They have a strong tendency to intellectualize their emotions rather than express their sensitive natures. 

## Relationships
- 12/3s benefit from asking themselves periodically during the day, "How do 1 really feel right now?"
- They should express these feelings in some way - not just the safe, "okay" feelings, but also anger, impatience, shame, embarrassment, jealousy, and competitiveness.
- They have a tendency to withdraw emotionally.
- The core of a strong relationship for 12/3s is emotional contact, even if this means passionate arguments.

## Working 12/3 in the Positive
- 12/3s do brilliant and sensitive work.
- Their body is relaxed, supple, and relatively free of tension because they express their feelings as they arise.
- They breathe deeply and easily. 
- They thrive on honesty and emotional acceptance.
- They feel genuine pleasure in uplifting others through their caring words.

## Working 12/3 in the Negative
- 12/3s give mixed messages; they act confident and then collapse under the weight of criticism.
- They come back with cutting remarks and hurt back or withdraw, all without revealing their authentic feelings.
- Over time, their physical tension and lack of suppleness reflect the degree of emotion they are suppressing.
- They are filled with self-doubt and stifled emotions, insecurity, and blocked creativity.

## Guidelines and Recommendations
